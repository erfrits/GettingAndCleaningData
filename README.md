## Course project solution

The repository contains my solution for the Gatting and cleaning data course on Coursera.

### The goal of the project
the goal of the project is a tidy dataset created from a set of datafiles and the corresponding R script.

### Assumptions
* dplyr package is installed
* the user has read and write rights in his/her current working directory
* the user has a working Internet connection

### The process implemented in the R code:
1. Prepering the working environment
1.1 Creating and setting a temporary working directory
  1.2 Downloading the data (it is a compressed file)
  1.3 Unzipping the received data file
2. 


### Files in the repository:
* CodeBook.md: list and description of the variables in the output
* run_analisys.R: script to create a tidy data set from data collected from mobile phone accelerometers and gyroscopes (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
* README.md: this file :)
